# The Prince by Machiavelli

## Notes

- Too diagnose problem early can be difficult but to tackle/solve it early is easier. Romans: "there is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others"
- Support the weaker powers without increasing their strength, crush the powerful and do not allow them to win prestige.
- Centralization vs decentralization (localism); 15th century Turks vs 15th century France; Turkish emperor and his administrators vs french king and his nobles; difficult to conquer but easy to hold vs easy to conquer but difficult to hold
  -> Alexander the Great conquered territories
  -> Afghanistan very local loyalties

- Without opportunity prowess goes to waste but without prowess the opportunity passes without being seized
  -> rephrase this

- Princedoms equivalent to modern day companies?
- Violence once intensely, Benefits gradually
- Build up Goodwill before adversity because during it a granted favor will seem disingenuous and will have little effect.
- We as humans add layers of abstraction. Things become commodities and we "fight" on a higher level; computer viruses for control of infrastructure for example.
- Machiavelli: "Foundation of every state is good arms and good laws. You can't have good laws without good arms"
- -> Modern day equivalent?

- Medieval mercenaries equivalent to modern day hedgefunds/money manager?
  -> agency problem
  -> manage your own money or clear alignment of incentives

- Mercenary armies bring only slow, belated and feeble conquest but sudden startling defeat.
  -> selling tail risk

- NDAs exist so corporations don't have to kill former employees
- Create your own armies, don't rely on mercenaries because they do not allign with you.
- Often being neutral is worse than picking a side even if your side loses
- All courses of action are risky:" Prudence consists in being able to assess the nature of a particular threat and in accepting the lesser evil"
  -> applies to investing and trading

- If everyone can speak the truth to you the you lose respect. Therefore pick few that can speak the truth to you but always make up your own mind. P101
- Prosperity is ephemeral, continuous adaption is key. Change so your fortune doesn't change.

- Impetuous > circumspect
  -> take more chances, especially romantically/dating
