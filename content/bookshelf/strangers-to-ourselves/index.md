# Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious by Timothy Wilson

## Notes

- Conscious and Unconscious processing
  - Like computer system (network card and you checking email)
  - Outsourcing tasks
- Emotions make decision making efficient
  - Feelings are functional (most of the time)
  - Adaptive Unconscious as a generator for gut feeling
- Activation potential of information in memory
  - How accesible an idea is
  - Informaci√≥n has high or low activation potential
- Unconscious vs Conscious
  - Unconscious is older from evolutionary perspective
  - Who is in control?
  -
- Extra information does not always increase accuracy of explanation
- Trying to quantify everything doesn't work
  - Pro contra lists
  - House requirements list example
- Concious can't access all the variables the Adaptive Unconscious takes in to
  reach a decision/liking something
- Introspection is a process of construction and inference; does not always
  unlock the full truth
